# Introduction #

Nodes form one of the fundamental aspects of an urban system. Most of the cities develop around such nodal points. Location of such nodes is an evolutionary behaviour. Influential books such as [The Image of the city](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=4065) by [Kevin Lynch](http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/collections-mc/mc208.html).

Considering the evolutionary nature of nodes, the system should have a provision for the generation of nodes.
But also in many cases nodes are existant ( while analysing an existing system ) and hence the system should also support file based input for location of nodes.

Work to be done
  * Format specification for the input file
  * Evolutionary algorithm for Node location
