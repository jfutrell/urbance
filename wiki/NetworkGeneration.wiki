#summary Generation of the transportation network

= Introduction =

The whole urban system revolves around the evolution of networks and the growth of blocks around and within such a network. So this could be considered the "core" of urban evolution.

Network generation mostly deals with connection of various nodes. But often nodes are not completely connected and also many transportation network links connect nodes with parts of the urban system which are not nodes. These two parts are separated in the present model. The internodal connection is being taken care of by NetworkGeneration and the further non-internodal connections and other parts of the network are being taken care of in SubgridGeneration

Some of the factors affecting connectivity modeling
 * Percentage of connectivity
 * Mode of connectivity ( Direct /Staggered etc. )
