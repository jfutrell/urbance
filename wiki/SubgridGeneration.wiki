#summary Generation of the subgrid

= Introduction =

Once the major transporation network has been generated including the internodal connections the left out space is the playground for generation of the Subgrid. By subgrid the implied space is the one not occupied by nodes and the internodal connections.


Subrid Generation should thus help in two aspects
 * Generation of non-internodal parts of the transporation network
 * Generation of a gridspace for the BuildingBlockGeneration


= Details =

At a later stage this part should also take into consideration other aspects such as 
  * [WaterModeling Water Modeling]
  * Non road based transporation network modeling
